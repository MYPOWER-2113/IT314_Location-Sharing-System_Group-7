# Location_Sharing_System:

## Project Description: 

A `location-sharing system` is an Android application allowing users to share their real-time locations with others.
This Android application uses GPS technology to determine a user's location and share it with others through social media or a messaging system.
Some famous examples which use the location-sharing system are Google Maps, Uber, Whatsapp, etc.
This application allows users to create groups and share their location with their family and friends.

One of the key benefits of these type of `location-sharing system` is increased safety and security. For example, parents may use this application to keep track of their 
children's whereabouts. Similar to this, relatives and friends can use location sharing tools to keep tabs on each other while travelling or participating in outdoor
activities.
This application can also be used for navigation purposes, especially when traveling to unfamiliar places. By sharing their location, individuals can easily
guide others to their destination or receive assistance from others when needed.

This application can be accessed through a variety of devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
In general, these types of `location-sharing systems` have become more and more popular since they provide a path to stay connected and share their location with others.
In summary, this android application allows individuals to share their real-time location with others. 
These systems offer a range of benefits, including increased safety and security, navigation assistance. 
However, users should be mindful of privacy and security concerns when using this application, and only share their location with trusted individuals.
